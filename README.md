# Ninja Stars

Ninja Stars is a tool designed to foster collaboration and support within bootcamp learning environments. It allows students to post help requests or advertise review sessions based on specific concepts, enabling better learning experiences through peer support.

## Features

- **Help Requests and Review Sessions**:
  Students can create, view, and manage help requests or review sessions focused on specific concepts.
- **REST API with JWT Authentication**:
  A secure REST API allows users to register and log in using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**:
  A standalone web app where users can view, filter, and manage help requests or review sessions.
- **Chrome Extension**:
  Automates actions like adding module links for concepts while providing the same functionality as the SPA.

  A React-based version of the SPA for users who prefer a modern front-end experience. (About 80% complete)
